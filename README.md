# 🚗 Road Safety Intervention GPT

**A next-gen AI system to analyze road data and recommend data-driven safety interventions.**

> ⚙️ *Currently in early development phase — project setup and research ongoing.*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Road Safety Intervention GPT** aims to combine the power of **AI, ML, and geospatial data** to suggest effective, location-specific interventions (like speed breakers, signage, or lane dividers) to reduce road accidents.

The idea was inspired by the **National Road Safety Hackathon 2025** theme at **IIT Madras**, focusing on building AI-driven solutions for safer transportation.

---

## 🎯 Vision

To build an AI assistant that can:
- Analyze real-world road and accident data.
- Suggest the most effective safety interventions.
- Simulate and visualize potential impact.
- Empower policymakers and engineers to make **data-backed decisions**.

---

## 🚧 Current Status

🧩 Researching datasets, architecture design, and model approaches.  
🧱 Tech stack planning in progress — development will begin soon.  
🎨 UI wireframes and backend API design being drafted.

---

## 🗺️ Planned Features

- 🧮 **Intervention Analysis Engine** — Predict best interventions based on road features, traffic density, and accident frequency.
- 💬 **AI Chat Interface** — Query road safety insights using natural language.
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map Dashboard** — Visualize accident-prone areas and suggested changes.
- 📊 **Simulation & Reports** — Estimate impact of interventions over time.
